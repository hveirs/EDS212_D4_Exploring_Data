Note: To control what shows up in the html/rendered file in a quarto doc, 
use a "hash-pipe" which is "#| " then warning: false, which makes warnings
disappear, or echo: false, which keeps the code from showing up but outputs 
are still shown. "include: false" makes the code and outputs not included in 
the render.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false


library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(GGally)
library(skimr)

```

## Exploratory Data Viz

Ways to check out and view the data:

```{r}
#| include: false

# Find the column names:
names(penguins)

# Find the dimensions
dim(penguins)

#Show the first 6 lines
head(penguins)

# Last 6 lines
tail(penguins)

```
